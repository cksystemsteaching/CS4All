## Compiler Construction

## Syllabus

## Software

The class essentially works by explaining the basic principles behind [selfie](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/selfie) which is a software system written in a tiny subset of C called C\* that implements a self-compiling compiler targeting a tiny subset of RISC-V machine code called RISC-U, a self-executing RISC-U emulator, and a self-hosting RISC-U hypervisor.

## Assignments

Selfie features an [autograder](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/selfie/tree/main/grader) for a variety of technical [assignments](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/selfie/tree/main/assignments).
Relevant here are the [compiler assignments](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/selfie/blob/main/assignments/compiler-assignments.md).

## References

There is a draft of a textbook on [Elementary Computer Science](https://github.com/ckirsch/book) that is currently being developed for the class. The draft includes references to the literature relevant here.
