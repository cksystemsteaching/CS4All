1. [Unicorn](https://github.com/cksystemsgroup/unicorn)
2. SMT Solving
3. SAT Solving
4. Adiabatic Quantum Computing
5. Gate-Model Quantum Machines

## Software

The class is based on the [unicorn](https://github.com/cksystemsgroup/unicorn) toolchain which encodes symbolic execution of RISC-V machine code in logically equivalent SMT and SAT formulae as well as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models and quantum circuits (QCs).
