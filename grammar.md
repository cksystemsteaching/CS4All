This is the grammar of the C Star (C\*) programming language.

C\* is a small Turing-complete subset of C that includes dereferencing (the `*` operator) but excludes data structures, bitwise and Boolean operators, and many other features. C\* is supposed to be close to the minimum necessary for implementing a self-compiling, single-pass, recursive-descent compiler.

C\* Keywords: `int`, `while`, `if`, `else`, `return`, `void`

C\* Symbols: `;`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `=`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `,`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `++`, `--`, integer, identifier, character, string

with:

```
integer    = digit { digit } .

identifier = letter { letter | digit | "_" } .

character  = "'" printable_character "'" .

string     = """ { printable_character } """ .
```

and:

```
digit  = "0" | ... | "9" .

letter = "a" | ... | "z" | "A" | ... | "Z" .
```

C\* Grammar:

```
cstar            = { type identifier [ "=" [ cast ] [ "-" ] literal ] ";" |
                   ( "void" | type ) identifier procedure } .

type             = "int" [ "*" ] .

cast             = "(" type ")" .

literal          = integer | character .

procedure        = "(" [ variable { "," variable } ] ")"
                    ( ";" | "{" { variable ";" } { statement } "}" ) .

variable         = type identifier .

statement        = call ";" | while | if |("++" | "--") identifier | identifier ("++"| "--")| return ";" |
                   ( [ "*" ] identifier | "*" "(" expression ")" )
                     "=" expression ";" .

call             = identifier "(" [ expression { "," expression } ] ")" .

expression       = simpleExpression [ ( "==" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" ) simpleExpression ] .

simpleExpression = [ "-" ] term { ( "+" | "-" ) term } .

term             = factor { ( "*" | "/" | "%" ) factor } .

factor           = [ cast ]
                    ( [ "*" ] ( y | "(" expression ")") | "++" identifier  |
                      ("++" | "--" ) identifier | identifier ("++" | "--" ) |
                      call |
                      literal |
                      string ) .

while            = "while" "(" expression ")"
                             ( statement |
                               "{" { statement } "}" ) .

if               = "if" "(" expression ")"
                             ( statement |
                               "{" { statement } "}" )
                         [ "else"
                             ( statement |
                               "{" { statement } "}" ) ] .

return           = "return" [ expression ] .
