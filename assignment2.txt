This file briefly describes the way the address-operator & and function pointers are
tested in assignment2.c. The code itself is also commented.

- In Example A, we apply the address operator & to a local variable and
  assign its address to a pointer variable. The value of the local variable
  is then modified through the pointer

- In Example B, an array with function pointers to simple arithmetic functions is created.
  We then iterate through the array an apply each function via its pointer to some int values as parameters

- In Example C, we imitate the work of a function factory. That is, the factory function is given an
  int value in [0, 3] as parameter. Based on this choice, a function pointer to the corresponding
  arithmetic function is returned

- In Example D, we specifiy the sorting done by SelectionSort with a comparator. That is, the sorting
  function is given a pointer to a comparator function as a parameter. Based on this, the sorting is done.
