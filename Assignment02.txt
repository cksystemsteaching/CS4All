Part 1: (Ampersand)

Syntax like in normal c

new possibilities:

	standard case:
		-assign addresses of variables and pointers:
			int a = 3;
			int b = 5;
	
			a = &b; // a gets address of b ( a = 5 because a points to the address where b points to)

	special case:
		-*&identifier -> works with variables and pointers (useless because it does the same as identifier)
		- ++ operator incompatible with & operator in selfie

Part 2: (function pointers)

Syntax:
using normal pointers as function pointers
example:
  int* fctPtr;
  int helper;
  fctPtr = &doIt;

  helper = $fctPtr(9999);

  int doIt(int number){
  	 int a;
 	 a = number;
 	 return a;

  }

new possibilities:
	-call function with pointer and save value in variable
	-call function with pointer 
	->both possible global and local
	-function pointers as arguments do not work
