This course motivates and explains the basic principles of computer science. We will introduce all relevant layers and study their connection, from the lowest levels of machine architecture via programming languages, algorithms, compilers, and virtual machines to the highest levels of cloud computing. For this purpose we use code examples from the [Selfie Project](http://selfie.cs.uni-salzburg.at) which is an educational system of a self-compiling C compiler, a self-executing MIPS emulator, and a self-hosting MIPS hypervisor. Discussions are held in the `#cs4all` [slack channel](https://cksystemsteaching.slack.com/signup).
