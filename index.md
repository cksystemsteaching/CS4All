## About

We are the [Computational Systems Group](http://www.cs.uni-salzburg.at/~ck) at the University of Salzburg, Austria. We work on the problem of how to *engineer* systems software rigorously and how to apply that knowledge to *teach* computer science in ways that may eventually make computer science more accessible to more people.

## Teaching

We teach *basic principles of computer science* on bachelor and masters level covering all relevant layers of computer systems and their connection, from the lowest levels of machine architecture via programming languages, compilers, and virtual machines which includes algorithms, data structures, complexity, and computability, to the highest levels of cloud computing.

In all our classes, we use [Selfie](http://selfie.cs.uni-salzburg.at), an educational system of a self-compiling C compiler, a self-executing RISC-V emulator, and a self-hosting RISC-V hypervisor that comes with source code, slides, and an autograder.

## Target Audience

Our target audience is:

1. Professionals:
2. Software Engineers:
3. Computer Scientists:

## Goal

Our goal is to enable students understand and answer fundamental and intrinsically self-referential questions such as:

1. Compilation: How can software create the *semantics* or *meaning* of any high-level programming language including the language in which that software is written?
2. Emulation: How can software imitate the *semantics* of low-level machine code, that is, the *behavior* of any computer including the one it runs on?
3. Virtualization: How can software create a *virtual*, that is, *indistinguishable* version of any computer including the one it runs on?
