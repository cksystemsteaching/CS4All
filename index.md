## About

We are the [Computational Systems Group](http://www.cs.uni-salzburg.at/~ck) at the University of Salzburg, Austria. We work on the problem of how to *engineer* systems software rigorously and how to apply that knowledge to *teach* computer science in ways that may eventually make computer science more accessible to more people.

## Teaching

We teach basic principles of computer science on bachelor and masters level with a focus on systems (IOS) and applications (CS4Everyone), basic (SE) and advanced systems engineering (SWS), and compiler construction (CC). We introduce all relevant layers of computer systems and study their connection, from the lowest levels of machine architecture via programming languages, algorithms, compilers, and virtual machines to the highest levels of cloud computing. In all classes, we use [Selfie](http://selfie.cs.uni-salzburg.at), an educational system of a self-compiling C compiler, a self-executing MIPS emulator, and a self-hosting MIPS hypervisor. General discussions are held in the [`#cs4all`](https://cksystemsteaching.slack.com/signup) slack channel.
