Basically what function pointer would allow you to do, is that you could save a series of functions in an array and decide with a function what function to call.
You will end up with nicer looking call up statements instead of a big switch/if then else block

f.e.:

fn_array [0] = fct1;
fn_array [1] = fct2;
fn_array [2] = fct3;

void callFct(statement)
  int idx = decideFct(statement)
  fn_array[idx]

Also it will allow you to pass functions as an argument to another function. This could be handled with flags or with passing over a function as a pointer


In gcc it allows you to basically write object oriented code.
