  "body": "This undergraduate course motivates and explains the basic principles of computer systems. We will introduce all relevant layers and study their connection, from the lowest levels of machine architecture via programming language, algorithm, compiler, and virtual machine design to the highest levels of cloud computing. For this purpose we use code examples from the [Selfie Project](selfie.cs.uni-salzburg.at) which is an educational system of a self-compiling C compiler, a self-executing MIPS emulator, and a self-hosting MIPS hypervisor.\r\n\r\n## Syllabus\r\n\r\n1.
